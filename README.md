## :clipboard: Description
### What is it?
<p>Project developed as a knowledge consolidation challenge for Alura's Front-End school.</p>

### What does it?
- Single page for new talents of a fictious company called OptimusTech. 
- Anchors for links to the rest of the site.
- Buttons to enter the site and register.
- Design made based on figma with 3 responsive layouts (smartphone, tablet and desktop).
